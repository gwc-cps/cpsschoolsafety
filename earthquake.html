      <h4>Supply List</h4>
      In order to prepare for a major earthquake, we compiled a list of supplies the American Red Cross recommends you keep on hand. Storing your earthquake bin in a garage may be a good idea because many garages are built on concrete floors and therefore will be more stable during a big quake. If no garage is available, then keeping items in a closet or storage room also works. The key thing, the geologic hazards program coordinator for OEM, Rizzo said, is accessibility and braced shelving. "The most important thing is to store your supplies in such a way that they won't fall." OEM also recommends keeping emergency supplies for up to seven days at your place of work.
"That way, if you're at your office when this happens, you'll have supplies for a week," Rizzo said. She advised people to keep their supplies near their desk and not in a locked supply closet.
