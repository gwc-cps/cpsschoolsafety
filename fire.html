  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <p><b>What do you do when you are stuck in a room and don't know if there is a fire?</b>
    <p>1) Check to see if there is smoke coming from under the doors. If there is, DON’T OPEN THE DOOR. 
      If you don’t see smoke, touch the door. 
      If the door is not hot, touch the doorknob. 
      If the doorknob is hot, it isn't safe to go outside.
  <p><b> What should you do when a fire alarm sounds?</b>
    <p>If you are on fire, stop, drop, and roll. 
      Stray students should find a room, students must stay in their designated class.
  <p><b> What do teachers have to do when there is a fire? </b>
    <p> Take attendance and document missing students.
      Take emergency supplies and include student roster. They shouldn't lock the door.
      When a fire alarm sounds, they should direct students to the safest exit and go to the safe areas. 
  <p><b> What do you do when your hair is on fire? </b>
    <p> Hairspray if flammable, so use at your own risk. 
      The best action would be to immediately douse your head with water or to smother the fire with a towel, blanket or other suitable material.
      While your hair will be very different, your normal hair should grow back eventually.  
      Call your stylist and book an appointment ASAP, if you try to fix the damage yourself you will only ruin it further.
      “If your hair is the only victim, reach for your phone—you're going to need to see your stylist stat."
